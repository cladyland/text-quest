#### Text quest
This is my third project on JavaRush.
### About project
The main idea: a small text quest in which the player answers questions. Each subsequent question depends on the previous one. In case of victory or defeat, the player has the opportunity to review his statistics, as well as start the game again.

#### notice
_My mentors often remind us that everything can be Googled. I agree with that. But there is one important thing that I understood only in new conditions... for this there must be light and the Internet :)_

_This project was really challenging and very interesting. Despite everything, it's a great experience. Sorry guys for the uninformative readme file... I was really trying to write good code._
